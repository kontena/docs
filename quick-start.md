# Quick Start

The average time for Kontena users to get from zero to hero is just under 20 minutes! Let's assume you have already created some amazing application and packaged it as docker containers, here's what it takes to get from zero to hero with Kontena:

1. Sign-up to Kontena Cloud.
2. Create an organization for Kontena Platforms.
3. Create a [Kontena Platform](using-kontena/platform.md).
4. Install [Kontena Nodes](using-kontena/nodes.md).
5. Deploy first [Kontena Stack](using-kontena/stacks.md).
6. Operate Kontena Cloud with Kontena CLI tool

## Step 1. Sign-up to Kontena Cloud

You can sign-up to Kontena Cloud by following this link: https://cloud.kontena.io/sign-up

## Step 2. Create an Organization

After you have signed up and verified your email, you can create an organization for your project. An organization is a workspace for development teams to monitor, manage and operate Kontena Platforms.

## Step 3. Create a Kontena Platform

The Kontena Platform will abstract all available compute resources and make these resources available to your container workloads. To create your first Kontena Platform, just open the 'Create Platform' dialog and fill in the platform name. For testing purposes, the Mini platform type is enough.

<img src="_images/kontena-cloud-create-platform.png" alt="Create Platform" />

After clicking the 'Create' button your Kontena Platform will be provisioned shortly to Kontena Cloud.

## Step 4. Install Kontena Nodes

When the platform is ready you'll need some Kontena Nodes to run your containerized workloads.

After selecting Kontena Cloud as the provider and clicking the 'Add nodes' button, terminal windows should open and you can choose a node type and the number of nodes you want to create.

<img src="_images/kontena-cloud-provision-nodes.png" alt="Provision Nodes" />

You can always execute `cloud node create` later in the terminal to provision additional Kontena Nodes to your Kontena Platform.

**Note!** While Kontena will work with just a single Kontena Node, it is recommended to have at least three Kontena Nodes provisioned in a Grid.

If you followed the steps above, you should now have a working Kontena setup installed. Verify the setup using the `node list` command. It should list all the Kontena Nodes in your Kontena Platform.

```
> node list
NAME              VERSION   STATUS       INITIAL   LABELS
⊛ damp-forest-2   1.4.0     online 11s   1 / 1     region=eu-west-1,az=a,provider=kontena
```

## Step 5. Deploy Your First Application Stack

After the provisioned node is online, you are ready to deploy your first application stack. To install a ready-made stack you can execute the `stack install kontena/hello-world` command in terminal.

<img src="_images/kontena-cloud-install-stack.png" alt="Install Stack" />

The initial stack deployment may take some time while the host nodes pull the referenced Docker images.

After the stack deployment is finished, you can verify from the Kontena Cloud Dashboard that the lb and web services are running or executing the `stack ls` command:

```
> stack ls
NAME            STACK                       SERVICES   STATE     EXPOSED PORTS
⊛ hello-world   kontena/hello-world:1.0.0   2          running   *:80->80/tcp
```

To test the installed stack, you must connect to the IP address of the host node publishing the `lb` service on TCP port 80. You can use the public IP address of the host node running the service instance displayed as part of the Kontena service show output `service show hello-world/lb`:

```
> service show hello-world/lb
   ...
   hello-world/lb/1:
      scheduled_to: damp-forest-2
      deploy_rev: 2017-11-10 08:11:10 UTC
      rev: 2017-11-10 08:11:10 UTC
      state: running
      containers:
        hello-world.lb-1 (on damp-forest-2):
          dns: lb-1.hello-world.quick-start.kontena.local
          ip: 10.81.128.41
          public ip: 18.194.195.204
          status: running
```

You can also browse services on the Kontena Cloud Dashboard to see stats, logs and configuration of each deployed stack service.

To explore and install ready-made stacks you can use the `stack reg search` command or see the following examples:

- [PostgreSQL Cluster (stolon)](https://github.com/kontena/kontena-stacks/tree/master/stolon)
- [Kong API Gateway](https://github.com/kontena/kontena-stacks/tree/master/kong)
- [Wordpress Cluster](https://github.com/kontena/kontena-stacks/tree/master/wordpress-cluster)

## Next Steps: Operating Kontena Cloud with Kontena CLI tool
In order to operate the Kontena Platform from your local computer, you need first to install the Kontena CLI:

### MacOS (OSX)

You can install the Kontena CLI using our [official installer](https://gh-releases.kontena.io/kontena/kontena/pkg/latest) or [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) :

```
$ brew install kontena
```

### Debian / Ubuntu

You can install the Kontena CLI using our [official deb package](https://gh-releases.kontena.io/kontena/kontena/deb/latest).

### Linux / Windows

> Prerequisites: You'll need Ruby version 2.1 or later installed on your system. For more details, see the official [Ruby installation docs](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).


You can install the Kontena CLI using the Rubygems package manager, which is included in Ruby.

```
$ gem install kontena-cli
$ kontena plugin install cloud
```

**OPTIONAL**

To enable tab-completion for bash, add the following to your `.bashrc` scripts:

```
which kontena > /dev/null && . "$( kontena whoami --bash-completion-path )"
```
### Start using Kontena CLI

After installing the CLI, you are required to login to Kontena Cloud:

```
$ kontena cloud login
```

After the login is completed succesfully you can start using your Kontena Platform:

```
$ kontena cloud platform use <org>/<platform>
```

You are now ready to execute Kontena CLI commands.

## Congratulations -- Enjoy!
